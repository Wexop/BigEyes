# Big Eyes

Add a new monster to the game. Don't look if he's awake...

You want to custom the enemy behavior ? There are a lot of configs for that, check it ! **Make sure that every player have the same configs.**

Also add a scrap item that is the first model version of BigEyes, you can use it like an air horn to have the old angry animation !

For any issue or suggestion, feel free to open an issue on the GitHub project :)
